# htmlcss-miniproject04
This project was part of my learning challenge - front and back end development.
I have no experience yet in Full stack development.
My goal is to learn both development, and master the fundamentals in developing web pages and also its back end processes.
This is a sample landing page, created with pure html and css without using any frameworks.

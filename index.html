                    A product description is copy that informs
                    potential customers about the product’s benefits to convince 
                    them to buy. Great product descriptions give compelling reasons
                    to consider making a purchase based on the needs of target customers.
                    The “compelling reasons” are the main feature of strong product
                    descriptions. Theres a common misconception that product descriptions
                    need to describe the product. Their main job is actually to persuade
                    customers to buy, which is more likely to happen when they focus on
                    benefits, not features.
